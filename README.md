# MapService

Lab project: build a cloud service to let robots synchronize their location and SLAM maps

NOTE: since this project was originally developed using a password protected repository you might encounter dead links.

## What's included?

1. A roboter simulation using python
2. Code to deploy the cloud including elasticsearch for storage and a React.js frontend to visualize the shared map and robot positions (real time and playback)

## How to use
While you can run the project standalone it is recommended to use Docker to scale the components.
Detailed information about the system, as well as how to deploy it are available in the [documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cestcedric/MapService/master/Documentation.pdf).
